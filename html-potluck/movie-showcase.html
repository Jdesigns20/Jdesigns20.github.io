        <h3> SYNOPSIS</h3>
        <p> Set in post-war rural Japan, the film tells the story of the 
            Kusakabe family, which includes university professor Tatsuo and 
            his two daughters, Satsuki (around ten years old) and Mei 
            (about four). They move to an old house near the hospital where 
            their mother is recovering from an illness. The house is inhabited 
            by small, dust-like spirits called susuwatari, which the girls soon 
            discover. One day, while exploring the nearby forest, Mei 
            encounters a large, friendly creature known as Totoro. This 
            magical being becomes a source of comfort and adventure for the 
            sisters. The film beautifully depicts their interactions with 
            Totoro and other forest spirits, including the whimsical Catbus.
